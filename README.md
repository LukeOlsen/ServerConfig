# Server Configuration
This is a simple example of configuring a Linux server to host a Flask application using Apache. The IP address hosting my server is 3.92.130.244 and remote access is available on SSH port 2200. Rather than use xip.io I created a free DNS name using NOIP. The address is http://lukecatalog.hopto.org/.

# Software Installed
This project makes use of the following software:

1. Flask
2. Apache
3. SQLAlchemy
4. Psycopg2
5. Oauth2.client
6. Import
7. String
8. httplib2
9. requests
10. Virtualenv

# Third Party Resources
This project was solved utilizing the docs for Apache, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, and Flask. In addition it took a lot of googling to work my way through a lot of the errors I was getting so I would say I also utilized a fair bit of knowledge on Stack Overflow.
